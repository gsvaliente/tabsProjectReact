# ABOUT THE PROJECT

## WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

This is a small project, in which I practice how to use ReactJS. More specifically useState.
In addition, I was able to use some packages like ReactIcons and UUID.

## WHAT DID I DO?

The first step was to fetch from an API.
This was done with a custom hook I created. This fetches, sets loading, and an error.
Allowing the App.jsx to be a bit cleaner.

## GOAL?

To practice sending state through props and using onClick in said Components to change the App state.
